# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/user.jpg
    - assets/images/user.png
    - assets/images/logo.png
    - assets/images/measure.png
    - assets/images/pallet.png
    - assets/images/sacks.png
    - assets/images/backgroundOlive.jpg
    - assets/images/olivo_white.png
    - assets/images/new_logo.png
    - assets/images/arabic_await.png
    - assets/images/french_await.png
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Monoton
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Monoton-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400

    - family: Lobster
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lobster-Regular.ttf
          weight: 700
    - family: FasterOne
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/FasterOne-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
    - family: Fascinate
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Fascinate-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
    - family: Bree
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/BreeSerif-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
